     <h2><u>4.	Field of the Invention :</u></h2> Railway safety System

     <h2><u><br>
       5.	Background of the invention :</u></h2> The innovation of smart railway crossing systems has been influenced by the need to enhance safety, technological advancements, urbanization, regulatory requirements, and the imperative to improve traffic management and operational efficiency. These factors have collectively driven the adoption and integration of smart railway crossing systems into modern transportation infrastructure.<br> 

     <h2><u>6.	Summary of the invention :</u></h2> The smart railway crossing with object-detecting braking is an innovative solution designed to enhance railway safety by seamlessly integrating advanced technologies. This system employs state-of-the-art sensors, such as radar, lidar, or computer vision, to detect objects in the vicinity of the railway crossing. In the event of an identified obstacle, the system triggers an automatic braking mechanism, preventing potential collisions between trains and obstacles.<br>

This invention addresses the limitations of traditional railway crossings by introducing a proactive and automated approach to safety. The real-time object detection capability ensures swift and accurate responses, mitigating the risks associated with human error and unexpected obstacles on the tracks. By combining sensor technology with braking systems, the smart railway crossing significantly reduces the likelihood of accidents, thereby safeguarding both passengers and railway infrastructure. This innovation represents a crucial step towards making railway crossings more intelligent, efficient, and secure.
 



     <h2><u>7.	Detailed description of the invention with accompanying</u></h2><br>
(1). The accidents that happen in railway crossings  because of which we have made railway crossings fully automatic in which when the train comes near the railway crossings, only then the sensor will detect the train or the gate will be closed or then the train will move away from the railway crossing. Go ahead, the gate will open automatically.<br>
     (2). Our project detects any object, whether it is a human being, an animal or a vehicle and after sensing it, it applies the brakes which prevents accidents.
railway environment for all stakeholders.
     <h2><u>  8) Advantages:</u></h2>
●	Accidents will be resolved with the help of our projects.<br>
●	It enhance traffic management at railway crossings.<br>
●	It is cost efficient.<br>




     <h2><u>9)  Claim :</u></h2> 
●	Economical and cost effective system..<br>
●	Trouble free.<br>
●	Labor Saving.<br>
●	Saves time for mankind and reduces the probe of touchability.<br>

●	Automated.<br>




     <h2><u>10) Abstract :</u></h2> The system has two types of sensors that detect the train's arrival and sends a signal to the Arduino microcontroller to control the crossing system and also sense object for safe braking. The Arduino board then process the signals and sends command to the motor driver to open or close the crossing gate and also process the braking system . The gate remains closed until the train passes, and then it opens automatically.<br>
      The system uses detection sensors to detect approaching trains. When a train arrives at the sensing point, an alarm is triggered at the railway crossing point. This notifies people that the gate is going to be closed. The system can be employed in unmanned level crossings where the chances of accidents are higher and reliable operation is required.<br>
